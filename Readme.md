## The repo provides the following files:  
 
   * #### find the biggest element of a one dimentional array and return its index
   * #### find if a  one dimentional array cointans zeros
   * #### find the smallest element of a one dimentional array and return its index
   * #### find the number of even elements for each row in a two dimentional array
   * #### find the smallest element for each row of a two dimentional array      
   * #### sum all positive elements from a two dimentional array
   * #### how the row where all elements of a two dimentional array are positive    

### Instructions to run the files
